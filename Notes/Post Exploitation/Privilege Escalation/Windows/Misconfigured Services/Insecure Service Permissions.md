# Insecure Service Permissions

This is a technique which leverages misconfigurations in the service permissions for a specific user. If permissions for a specific user differ from the ones described in the table [here](../../../../Post%20Exploitation/Privilege%20Escalation/Windows/Misconfigured%20Services/Notes/Post%20Exploitation/Privilege%20Escalation/Windows/Misconfigured%20Services/index.md), then they may manifest as a possible vulnerability.

To identify such services, it is useful to use WinPEAS.&#x20;

It appears that `user` has write access to the service `daclsvc` and can also start the service. We can query the service to see what user account is actually executing it:

```powershell
sc qc <service>
```

![](<Resources/Images/Query Service.png>)

It appears that the service is running as `LocalSystem` which is an account with more privileges than our `user` account. If we can write to the service, then we can alter its configuration and change the path to the executable which is supposed to be run:

```powershell
sc config <service> binpath="\"<path>\""
```

All we now need to do is setup a listener and run the service:

```powershell
net start <service>
```

And we get a system shell back:
