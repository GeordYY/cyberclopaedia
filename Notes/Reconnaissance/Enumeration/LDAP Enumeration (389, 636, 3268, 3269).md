# Introduction
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol which enables the locating of organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network.

An LDAP directory may be split across multiple servers. Each server can have a version of the total directory which is periodically synchronized. An LDAP server is called a Directory System Agent (DSA).

LDAP directories are organised in a tree hierarchy as follows:

- The root directory
- Countries
- Organisations
- Organisational units (OUs) - divisions and departments
- Individuals - these can be people, files, printers, etc.
