Experimental support for inline Mathjax is now provided using a [custom preprocessor](https://github.com/cr0mll/mdbook-inline-mathjax). If you find that any LaTeX is not rendered properly, please create a GitHub issue including the chapter name that contains the broken LaTeX. Furthermore, in this case you should view the Cyberclopaedia [here](https://github.com/cr0mll/cyberclopaedia) on GitHub.
