# Scheduled Tasks

Windows Scheduled Tasks allow for the periodic execution of scripts. These can be manually enumerated via the following command:

```powershell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v 
```

A scheduled task is of interest when it is executed with elevated privileges but we have write access to the script it executes.

![](<../../../Post Exploitation/Privilege Escalation/Windows/Resources/Images/Scheduled CleanUp Contents.png>)

This script is fairly simple, so we can just append a line to it which executes a malicious executable.

When the time for the scheduled task comes, we will catch an elevated shell.
