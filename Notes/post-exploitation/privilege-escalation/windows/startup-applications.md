# Startup Applications

Windows Startup applications are very similar to [AutoRun Programmes](autorun-programmes.md), however, they are executed every time a user logs in. If we can write to the Startups directory, then we can place a malicious executable there which will be executed upon the next login. If the next user to log in is an administrator, then we will gain elevated privileges.

To check for write access to the Startups directory, we can use `accesschk`:

```powershell
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -d "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"
```

All we need to do is place a malicious executable in the directory and wait for an admin to log in.
